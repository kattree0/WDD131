        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <img class = "me" src="me.png" alt="picture of the artist">
        <p>My name is Natalie, but I usually sign all my artworks under the name kattree. That's with a lowercase k! I grew up in a small town in the middle of nowhere. I started drawing whenever I was about 11 or 12. <a href ="https://aminoapps.com/c/jam-on/page/blog/bad-wolf-art/eY8R_Xlwu3ubK1pj5zPlVW7eKeDD0kwPJNRSQ" target = "_blank">My first pieces</a> were from this game called Animal Jam. I met a little community of artists which inspired me to keep drawing. Unlike most artists, I never really followed after a single style to help me learn, which means that my art style is completely my own. Slowly over these 10 years I have improved. These days I will usually draw my own characters or the various things that I am interested in. Also almost everything is drawn with my finger ^-^</p>
