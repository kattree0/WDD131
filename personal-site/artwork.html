            <img src="frens.png" alt="Two furry friends sitting in a cave next to a waterfall">
            <p>I really wanted to draw the two of us(kattree and Katari) having a friendly chat. I also was in the mood to draw a background so I chose the only one I'm good at: caves!!</p>

            <img src="kett.png" alt="Katari Kityama drawing. It is a pink and white fox-like creature">
            <p>I made a new furry friend. The first mandatory thing one must do when meeting a furry as an artist is to draw thier fursona! This is his own species called kyvera!</p>

            <img src="yabloki.png" alt="Russian boy holding apples while asking a girl out in russian.">
            <p>I watched <a href = "  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efTclUUGAZw" target ="_blank" >this Russian short film</a> where one of my favourite muscial artists played the main actor, and I really enjoyed it(at least as much as I could understand with my limited Russian knowledge)!! I drew the cute little scene where Andrei tries to ask his crush our with some apples.  </p>

            <img src="zenny.png" alt="Okina's(my friend) OC">
            <p>I was looking through my friend's artworks and I found this little gem right here. After expressing his beauty to her, she gave me some reference sheets and I drew him! He's her Romainian OC.</p>

            <p>I was making opposite characters and this was one of the few that I liked.             <a href = "dzhark.webp"target ="_blank">This</a> is his original design; his clothes have changed since then because the og one looked too weird imo. His hair will also change because I was told that it was unnatural.</p>

            <img src="russian-goober.png" alt="A russian man in a tracksuit holding vodka and a drawing tablet, rides a bear in a snow storm.">
            <p>This was created based off a prompt a random Russian on steam gave me. It read "Yes, Iâ€™m Russian, this style came about when I was riding a bear, I had vodka in one hand and a drawing tablet in the other. :p2chell:" Here is the link to that if you are curious.             <a href = "https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3283373103" target ="_blank">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3283373103</a>

            <h2>Precious Cargo</h2>
            <img src="precious_cargo2.png" alt="Skylar carrying kattree through burning buildings">
            <p>The whole backstory of Skylar is that he's saving people from various war-torn planets. This is an example of one. He is saving kattree in this one, and yes he is very worried(he kind of finds her cute so that isn't helping his nerves.)</p>

            <img src="skylar.png" alt="skylar">
            <p>After watching         <a href = "https://youtu.be/HFQn7Br_a8A?si=BvU5NcQXzbHh6lfJ" target ="_blank" > this video</a> a couple of times. I determined that it would be cool to have my own masked character. Skylar is basically an improved version of             <a href = "skylar.webp" target ="_blank"> this guy </a>

            <img src="the_dreamss_me.png" alt="Kattree person is happy about dream">
            <p>According to myself, this is based off of a dream and a song? I don't know what song? I remember the dream but not the song blehhh. I did make a             <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyFGho_4IdM" target ="_blank"> timelapse </a> of it though!! Ignore the fact I open discord :sob:</p>

            <h2>Kawaii Terrorist</h2>
            <img src="tside.png" alt="Defult T-side guy from cs2 looking cutesy">
            <p>I had taken an interest in the design of the terrorist characters in the game Counter-Strike 2. I decided to draw him in a cutesy fashion because it is an interesting contrast to his job. I had also thought of him as cute at the time as well (Don't worry, I do NOT find his actions cute though) </p>

            <h2>Springy Mirage</h2>
            <img src="mirage.png" alt="Mirage from Apex legends but he's in a little dress">
            <p>This is Mirage from Apex Legends. He at this time was my favourite legend to play, so I really wanted to draw him. I asked my friend what I should draw of him doing, and she told me to draw him in a dress. I'm not sure how easy it would be to win the Apex Games in a dress but he's slaying.</p>

            <h2>Poker the Boys!</h2>
            <img src="lethal_company.png" alt="A blob, bracken, and spider play poker with a dead employee in the background.">
            <p>"because the creatures have always been apart of the boys?" I made this whenever I had barely played lethal company for 10 hours. I included only the creatures and loot I had come across(which was very small in comparison to what the game had to offer). This was way too much fun to make, and I really really like how it turned out.
